## Datasets

The basic object in Spada is a dataset. A dataset is an object of the data.frame class. Internally, for speed and programmability purposes, Spada uses the data.table class from the [**data.table**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) package.

So, Spada demands at least one dataset. If none is provided in the funcion call then Iris and Mtcars, from datasets package, are used as sample data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(spada)
spada()
```

For multiples datasets as input:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spada(iris, mtcars, cars)
```

### Dataset Names

If the user desires to give names to datasets, then the Spada function should be called like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spada('dataset' = iris, 'test_data' = mtcars)
```

Spada will make valid and unique names with **make.names** function. So:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spada('dataset 1' = iris, 'test data' = mtcars, 'dataset 1' = cars)
```

Will result in names: dataset.1, test.data and dataset.1.1.

If the user inform at least one name, Spada will assume that the datasets should receive a name (instead the name of the original object) and **will create valid and unique names** using dataset_n, being n a sequencial number:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spada('dataset 1' = iris, mtcars, cars)
```

Will result in names: dataset.1, dataset_2 and dataset_3.

### Active Dataset

The dataset in which the operations will be applied are the Active dataset. One can think of this dataset as the current object. As Spada requires at least one dataset, won't be possible to delete the Active dataset.

## Navbar

Spada uses a page_navbar from bslib package. In the left side are the menus that lead to the app pages. In the right side are the Active dataset name.
